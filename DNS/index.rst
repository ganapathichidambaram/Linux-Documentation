What is DNS ?
--------------------------

Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed naming system to translates fully qualified domain name to the numeric IP Address and vice-versa for computers,services, or any resource connected to the internet or private network.

It distributes the responsbility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to IP addresses by desingating authoritative name servers for each domain. Authoritative name servers are assigned to be responsible for their supported domains,and may delegate authority over sub-domains to other name servers.

DNS Name Server stores the DNS records for a domain name and it responds with answers to queries againts DNS database.

DNS Database records types are :

- DNS Zone Authority (SOA)
- IP addresses ( A )
- SMTP Mail Exchangers (MX)
- Name Servers (NS)
- Pointers for Reverse DNS lookups (PTR)
- Domain Name Aliases (CNAME)
